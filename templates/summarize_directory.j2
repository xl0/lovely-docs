You are summarizing a directory of documentation for a library.

Directory name: {{ dir_name }}

{% if subdirs %}
## Subdirectories in this directory:

{% for subdir in subdirs %}
### {{ subdir.better_name or subdir.name }}
{{ subdir.short_summary }}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if pages %}
## Pages in this directory:

{% for page in pages %}
### {{ page.better_filename }}
{{ page.short_summary_markdown }}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Based on the subdirectories and pages above, create:
1. A better name for this directory that captures its content (short, 2-4 words, lowercase with hyphens)
2. A short summary (2-4 sentences) that captures the main topics covered in this directory section.
    Write in a declarative style stating what things ARE or DO, not "guide to" or "documentation for".
    Provide up to 1 comprehensive example when appropriate.
3. A one-line summary of what this directory section covers. Use the same declarative style.

Be concise and focus on what's most important for a programmer.
