This page serves as the introduction to the Svelte documentation. It appears to be a landing page or overview section that introduces the Svelte framework to new users. The page contains only frontmatter with a title and no actual content body, suggesting it functions as a structural entry point to the documentation rather than containing substantive technical information.
