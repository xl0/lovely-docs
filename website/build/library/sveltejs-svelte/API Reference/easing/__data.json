These functions take a value between 0 and 1 (representing progress through an animation) and return an eased value, allowing you to create smooth, natural-looking motion effects.\n\nCommon easing functions include:\n- Linear: constant speed\n- Quadratic, Cubic, Quartic, Quintic: polynomial easing with varying intensity\n- Sine, Exponential, Circular: smooth curves with different characteristics\n- Elastic, Back, Bounce: specialized effects for springy or bouncy animations\n\nEach easing function typically has `In`, `Out`, and `InOut` variants that control whether the easing is applied at the start, end, or both ends of the animation.\n\nExample usage in a transition:\n```javascript\nimport { quintOut } from 'svelte/easing';\ntransition:fade={{ duration: 400, easing: quintOut }}\n```","The `svelte/easing` module provides easing functions (linear, quadratic, cubic, sine, exponential, elastic, bounce, etc.) with In/Out/InOut variants for controlling animation timing curves.\n\nExample: `import { quintOut } from 'svelte/easing'; transition:fade={{ duration: 400, easing: quintOut }}`","Module providing easing functions for animations and transitions with various timing curves."],"uses":{"params":["name","path"]}}]}
