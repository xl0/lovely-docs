## Billing & Wallet

**Billing Overview:** Cost breakdown chart by resource (RAM, CPU, storage) with area/bar chart options and date range filtering.

**Wallet Management:**
- Connect credit card for top-ups
- Set automatic top-up with threshold (trigger level) and target (final balance); set both to `0` to disable
- Redeem coupon codes for credits
- Add billing email addresses for invoices and credit depletion notices (requires verification)
