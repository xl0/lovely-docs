## Personal vs Collaborative Organizations

Personal organizations are automatic, single-user, no roles, per-user billing, non-deletable. Collaborative organizations are manual, multi-user with invite-based access, role-based permissions, shared billing and quotas, deletable by Owner.

## Roles and Assignments

**Roles**: Owners (full admin), Members (no admin, assignment-based access)

**Assignments**: Viewer (required, read-only), Developer (create sandboxes/keys), Sandboxes/Snapshots/Registries/Volumes/Infrastructure Admin, Super Admin (full access), Auditor (audit logs)

## Member Management

Owners can invite users (email → role selection), remove users, manage pending invitations, and update assignments. Users accept invitations to gain organization access and create API keys/sandboxes.
