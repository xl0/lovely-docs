## Registry

Create and host your own component registry to distribute custom components, hooks, pages, and other files to Svelte projects. Registry items are automatically compatible with the shadcn-svelte CLI.

### Requirements

Registry items must be valid JSON files conforming to the registry-item schema specification.

### Getting Started

Clone the template project as a starting point:

```bash
npx degit huntabyte/shadcn-svelte/registry-template#next-tailwind-4
```

**Note:** This feature is experimental. Feedback and testing are welcome via GitHub discussions.
