SvelteKit supports multiple rendering patterns: default (SSR + CSR), static site generation with `adapter-static`, SPAs with CSR only, serverless with `adapter-vercel`/`adapter-netlify`/`adapter-cloudflare`, own server with `adapter-node`, and can be deployed as mobile apps (Tauri/Capacitor), desktop apps (Tauri/Wails/Electron), browser extensions, or on embedded devices. Use `csr = false` to disable client-side rendering or `bundleStrategy: 'single'` to limit concurrent requests.
