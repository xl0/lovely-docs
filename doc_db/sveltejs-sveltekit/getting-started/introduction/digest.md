SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications with Svelte, similar to Next.js (for React) or Nuxt (for Vue). It handles modern best practices and common development challenges.

Svelte is a compiler that converts UI components into JavaScript and CSS. SvelteKit extends Svelte by providing a complete application framework with routing, build optimizations, offline support, preloading, configurable rendering (SSR, CSR, prerendering), image optimization, and hot module replacement via Vite.

Key differences: Svelte renders UI components; SvelteKit builds complete web applications with routing, server-side rendering, client-side rendering, prerendering, and development tooling.
