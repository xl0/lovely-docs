## Getting Started

Run `npx sv create my-app` to scaffold a new SvelteKit project. The CLI will prompt you to set up tooling like TypeScript. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server on localhost:5173.

## Core Concepts

- Pages are Svelte components
- Create pages by adding files to `src/routes` directory
- Pages are server-rendered on first visit for performance, then client-side app takes over

## Editor Setup

Use Visual Studio Code with the Svelte extension for the best experience. Other editors are supported via the Svelte Society resources.
