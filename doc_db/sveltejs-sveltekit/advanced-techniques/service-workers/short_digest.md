SvelteKit automatically bundles `src/service-worker.js` for offline support and performance. Access `$service-worker` module for assets, build files, version, and base path. Example caches built app and static files on install, cleans old caches on activate, and serves from cache with network fallback on fetch. Disable auto-registration via config. During dev, manually register with `{ type: dev ? 'module' : 'classic' }`.
