Enable PostgreSQL Row-Level Security on tables with `.enableRLS()` or policies; define roles with `pgRole()` and policies with `pgPolicy(as, to, for, using, withCheck)` as table parameters; manage roles in drizzle.config.ts with `entities.roles` (true/exclude/include/provider); link policies to existing tables with `.link()`; use Neon's `crudPolicy()` or Supabase's predefined roles/tables/`createDrizzle()` wrapper.
