## Quick Start

Create a new SvelteKit project:

```sh
npx sv create my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

The CLI scaffolds a new project and optionally sets up TypeScript and other tooling. Development server runs on localhost:5173.

## Core Concepts

- Each page is a Svelte component
- Pages are created by adding files to `src/routes` directory
- Pages are server-rendered on first visit for performance, then client-side app takes over

## Editor Setup

Recommended: Visual Studio Code with the Svelte extension. Other editors are also supported via the Svelte Society editor support collection.
