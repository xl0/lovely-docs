Svelte 5 introduced significant API changes including runes, snippets, and event attributes. Svelte 3/4 features are deprecated but still supported and will eventually be removed. Incrementally migrate existing code using the v5 migration guide.

**Legacy vs Runes Mode:**
- Legacy mode: Svelte 3/4 syntax
- Runes mode: Opt in by using runes or setting `runes: true` compiler option
- Once in runes mode, legacy features are no longer available

For Svelte 3/4 syntax documentation, see v4.svelte.dev.
