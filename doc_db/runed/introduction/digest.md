Runed is a collection of utilities for Svelte 5 that extends Svelte Runes with powerful, commonly-needed functionality. It provides utility functions and classes that simplify common tasks and reduce boilerplate, serving as a single source of truth for utilities the community repeatedly writes.

Key features include:
- Powerful Utilities: Carefully crafted utility functions and classes for common tasks
- Collective Efforts: Community-contributed utilities tested and shared across projects
- Consistency: Uniform APIs and behaviors across all utilities
- Reactivity First: Built on Svelte 5's reactivity system to handle reactive state and side effects
- Type Safety: Full TypeScript support

Design principles:
- Embrace the Magic of Runes: Fully leverages Svelte Runes as a powerful paradigm
- Enhance, Don't Replace: Extends Svelte's core functionality naturally rather than replacing it
- Progressive Complexity: Simple defaults with advanced customization available
- Open Source and Community Collaboration: MIT licensed, welcomes contributions including bug reports, feature requests, and code
